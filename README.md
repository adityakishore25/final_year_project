We have used a library called playwright launches a headless browser. The file [automated scraping.py](https://github.com/adityakishore25/final_year_project/blob/main/twitter/automated-scraping.py) enables extraction of tweets of verified accounts into JSON format. This is done by first extracting tweet URL's and executing the script in multi-threaded manner.

After this the images and text are fed to Ollama3.2: 1b model for further analysis.

The folder [frontend-design](https://github.com/adityakishore25/final_year_project/tree/main/twitter/frontend-design) contains the templates , model and server files.
